    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Due to the recent epidemic of West Nile Virus in Chicago, the Disease And Treatment Agency of City of Chicago needs to know when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model predicting outbreaks of West Nile virus in mosquitos using exising data(weather, location, testing, and spraying data) will enable effective allocation of pesticide spraying resources to prevent virus transmission."

    "# Business Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[West Nile virus (WNV)](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html) cases occur during mosquito season, which starts in the summer and continues through fall. There are no vaccines to prevent or medications to treat WNV in people.\n",
    "West Nile virus is most commonly spread to humans through [infected mosquitos](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/transmission/index.html). Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds. Infected mosquitoes spread West Nile virus to people and other animals by biting them. West Nile virus has been detected in over 300 species of [dead birds](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/dead-birds/index.html). Although some infected birds, especially crows and jays, frequently die of infection, most birds survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 80% of the people Infected with West Nile virus do not develop any [Symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/symptoms/index.html)\n",
    "- Around 20% of people who become infected with the virus develop symptoms ranging from a persistent fever, to serious neurological illnesses that can result in death.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first human cases of West Nile virus were reported in Chicago in  [2002](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/west-nile-virus-in-the-greater-chicago-area-a-geographic-examinat). By 2004, the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) had established a comprehensive surveillance and control program that is still in effect today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitos in traps across the city are tested for the virus. The results of these tests influence when and where the city will spray airborne pesticides to control adult mosquito populations. This method is resource extensive and CDPH is looking for an aternative to decide where to spray."

    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are engaged by the Chicago Department of Public Health to study the epidemic of West Nile Virus in Chicago using the 3 DataSets of data collected by the Department of Public Health surveillance and control systems. \n",
    "    - The datasets are:\n",
    "        - Weather, \n",
    "        - Train, \n",
    "        - Spray Data\n",
    "    - As per initial analysis on the datasets provided : \n",
    "        - The Weather DataSet has 2944 Observations and 22 Features, \n",
    "        - The Train DataSet has 10506 Observations and 12 Features, \n",
    "        - The Spray DataSet has 14835 Observations and 4 Features.\n",
    "    - We built 8 classification models and evaluated the models. \n",
    "        - The top model was used to identify whether a location at a certain point in time has the West Nile Virus\n",
    "    - We used test dataset for testing to see it's predicting capabilities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- EDA \n",
    "    -  Data Cleaning : We cleaned the data in the datasets \n",
    "         - For Weather dataset, we did the cleaning by filling Null Values \n",
    "             - either with another observation (data collected from the other station)\n",
    "             - or using mean/median of the entire dataset\n",
    "         - for Train dataset, we did the cleaning by dropping repeated columns such as Address/Street/Block\n",
    "         - for Spray dataset, we did the cleaned by filling Null values with the respective time. \n",
    "             \n",
    "    - Exploration on cleaned data\n",
    "        - We plotted time series lineplot \n",
    "            - To look at time trend regarding the weather and \n",
    "            - How it affects the observations of West Nile Virus. \n",
    "        - We plotted countplot \n",
    "            - To look at the relationship between each of the features with respect to the West Nile Virus.\n",
    "        - We plotted a heatmap to determine \n",

    "            - Where West Nile Virus is found as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Engineering\n",
    "    - we added new features based on EDA to improve the model.\n",
    "    - We obserevd that the data was imbalanced for West Nile Virus\n",
    "         - about 94.76%(0) \n",
    "         - and 5.24%(1)\n",
    "     - Such a heavily unbalanced dataset  is not an ideal dataset to used for classification problems \n",
    "             ( baseline accuracy is 94.76%), so we balanced the dataset using SMOTE.\n",
    "     - We used PCA for Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Model and Evaluation : \n",
    "    - We built few models:\n",
    "        - Decision Tree, Extra Trees, Random Forest\\n\",\n",
    "        - Logistic Regression\\n\",\n",
    "        - Ada Boost, Gradient Boost\\n\",\n",
    "        - SVM\\n\",\n",
    "    - We recommend 3 models to address the business problem in short term, medium term and long term\n",
    "      - Logistics Regression model (with a score of 71.32% on test data) for short term\n",
    "       - AdaBoost Model(with a score of 70.21% on test data) to improved and used for medium term\n",
    "       - Gradient Boost model (with a score of 70.51% on test data) to be improved and used for long term\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next Actions \n",
    "     - For subsequent iterations to improve this model, \n",
    "         - We can explore improving Feature Reduction (Drop more features that may not have as much significance)\n",
    "             - Or \n",
    "         - We can collect larger and more balanced dataset \n",
    "         - And tune our model to improve its classification accuracy based on either or both of the above\n",
    "      - After improving the model accuracy, \n",
    "          - We can expand the usage to other States and \n",
    "          - Explore having subreddit auto-warning system to crowd source data\n",
    "              - The data from subreddit would warn users of possible West Nile Viruses happening \n",
