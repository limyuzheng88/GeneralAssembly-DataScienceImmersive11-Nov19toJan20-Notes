    "\n",
    "Before we get to regularization we need to review **overfitting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Overfitting* means building a model that matches the training data \"too closely.\" The model ends up training on noise rather than signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually caused by a model that is too complex \n",
    "- Low bias/high variance models\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Good\" properties\n",
    "- Low complexity\n",
    "- High bias/low variance \n",
    "- Does not tend to overfit\n",
    "\n",
    "Danger zone\n",
    "- Including irrelevant features (signal v noise)\n",
    "- (number of features) is close to (number of observations)\n",
    "- Correlated inputs\n",
    "- Numerically large coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of \"regularizing\" regression models is to structurally prevent overfitting by imposing a penalty on the coefficients of the model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization methods like the Ridge and Lasso add this additional \"penalty\" on the size of coefficients to the loss function. When the loss function is minimized, this additional component is added to the residual sum of squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In other words, model training becomes a balance between error and the size of the coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common types of regularization are the **Lasso**, **Ridge**. There is a mixture of them called the **Elastic Net**. We will take a look at the mathematics of regularization and the effect these penalties have on model fits.\n"

    "\n",
    "An important aspect of this data, which is a reason why we might choose to use regularization, is that there is **multicollinearity** in the data. The term multicollinearity means that there are _high correlations between predictor variables in your model_. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This can lead to a variety of problems including:**\n",
    "1. The effect of predictor variables estimated by your regression will depend on what other variabes are included in your model.\n",
    "2. Predictors can have wildly different effects depending on the observations in your sample, and small changes in samples can result in very different estimated effects.\n",
    "3. With very high multicollinearity, the inverse matrix the computer calculates may not be accurate.\n",
    "4. We can no longer interpret a coefficient on a variable as the effect on the target of a one unit increase in that variable holding the other variables constant. This is because when predictors are strongly correlated, there is not a scenario in which one variable can change without a conditional change in another variable.\n",

    "- The Lasso is particularly useful when you have redundant or unimportant variables. If you have 1000 variables in a dataset the Lasso can perform \"feature selection\" automatically for you by forcing coefficients to be zero.\n",
